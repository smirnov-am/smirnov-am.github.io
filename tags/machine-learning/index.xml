      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed suspicious transactions in my history that were initiated by some shady company that provides as the put it &amp;ldquo;opportunity to shop with discount&amp;rdquo; for their subscribers. Some web-shop had small font checkbox that initiated this subscription. Looks like the whole business model of such companies based on people who don&amp;rsquo;t check their transaction histories often. Needless to say, there were no subscription confirmation email, monthly bill or - most importantly - discounts I was supposed to receive.</description>

Supervised approach This is a multi-label, multi-class classification algorithm, where we may have following features as an input:
 text converted to bag-of-words text is treated as a stream of vectors, which are pre-trained word embeddings  For bag-of-words we may use linear SVM as a classifier.</description>
