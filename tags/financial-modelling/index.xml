      <description>The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as the discount rate for a firm’s anticipated free cash flows (FCFs) The formula is the following:
  whereE = market value of the firm’s equity D = market value of the firm’s debtTc = firm’s corporate tax raterE = firm’s cost of equityrD = firm’s cost of debt
There are some difficulties in calculating certain parts:1. Firm’s cost of equity rE has two approaches to it: Gordon model and capital asset pricing model (CAPM).</description>

In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover 3 methods of Enterprise Value calculations:
 using accounting book efficient market approach discounted cash flows (DCF)  The latter one - DCF - is a complex topic.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover:
 Net present value (NPV) Internal rate of return (IRR) Payment schedules and loan tables Future value Pension and accumulation problems Continuously compounded interest  Net present value Present value allows to answer a simple question &amp;ldquo;should I put my money in a bank or invest&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s say I have $100 and the bank gives a 12% annual interest rate. Alternatively, I can lend this money to a friend and he promises to pay $10 for 12 months.</description>
