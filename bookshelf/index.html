The usual approach to change software is &quot;Edit and Pray&quot;, which as not as safe

techniques of approaching convoluted, &#x27;spaghetti&#x27;-type legacy code and leave it

This book describes the techniques of approaching convoluted, 'spaghetti'-type legacy code and leave it in a better state after every refactoring attempt or adding a new feature. Basically, the techniques describe how to put the non-testable code under test. For example, chapters like "I Can’t Get This Class into a Test Harness" are full of examples of and methods. Unfortunately, the book relies on knowledge of Java/C/C++ and not much applicable to Python. It would be interesting to create snippets and examples for the methods in Python though.</p><h2 id="the-clean-coder-a-code-of-conduct-for-professional-programmers-us-eu-">The Clean Coder. A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers [<a href="https://amzn.to/2LDbafo">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2vpZQZ3">EU</a>] </h2><p>Nontechnical book on how to be a professional programmer. Describes many aspects such as work ethic, efficiency, interactions with managers and colleagues and attitude to the code itself. I like the comparison of a programmer profession to the one of a surgeon in this book. It helped to put my career into perspective and reconsider some things I'm doing at work as they were clearly were shown as bad examples of the craftsmanship</p><h2 id="code-complete-us-eu-">Code complete [<a href="https://amzn.to/2Kc8VxY">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2F3I2ba">EU</a>]</h2><p>I'll post some quotes from 34th chapter that describes the contents of this fundamental book:<br><br>"This book is mostly about the details of software construction: high-quality classes, variable names, loops, source-code layout, system integration, and so on. This book has de-emphasized abstract topics in order to emphasize subjects that are more concrete."<br><br>"A second major thread in this book is the idea that the process you use to develop software matters a surprising amount. On a small project, the talents of the individual programmer are the biggest influence on the quality of the software. Part of what makes an individual programmer successful is his or her choice of processes. On projects with more than one programmer, organizational characteristics make a bigger difference than the skills of the individuals involved do. Even if you have a great team, its collective ability isn’t simply the sum of the team members’ individual abilities."<br><br>"Another theme that runs throughout this book is an emphasis on code readability."</p><h1 id="python">Python</h1><h2 id="data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python-us-eu-">Data Structures and Algorithms in Python [<a href="https://amzn.to/2Y8YTAw">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2XUs22a">EU</a>]</h2><p>The book begins with a simple intro into Python syntax and concepts and then goes into the implementation of most popular algorithms. Think of this book as CLRS for Python. One of my favorite books in this section.</p><h2 id="fluent-python-us-eu-">Fluent Python [<a href="https://amzn.to/2H9c4fk">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2GQVcJR">EU</a>]</h2><p>In-depth Python. Start from simple syntax and goes into details of objects, concurrency (including async) and metaprogramming. Basically everything you need to know about the hard stuff in Python.</p><h2 id="learning-python-design-patterns-us-eu-">Learning Python Design Patterns [<a href="https://amzn.to/2Vm6uyF">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2GT2w86">EU</a>]</h2><p>All major design patterns - MVC, Singleton, observer, command, template, factory, facade - are explained and implemented in Python using language tweaks. A very useful book to read especially before interviews.</p><h2 id="python-parallel-programming-cookbook-us-eu-">Python Parallel Programming Cookbook [<a href="https://amzn.to/2Q0J8sN">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2GUUVWF">EU</a>]</h2><p>Covers thread, process, and async based parallelism as well as a very interesting topic of GPU programming directly. Describes a lot of low-level details like a lock, semaphores, etc. It also has a chapter about distributed processing with different libraries including Celery.</p><h2 id="python-for-data-analysis-us-eu-">Python for Data Analysis [<a href="https://amzn.to/2YfIn1U">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2XPNO7i">EU</a>]</h2><p>Covers such must-haves as numpy, pandas and matplotlib. Lots of examples.<br>It has a chapter in IPython, which I think is less popular as Jupyter. Apart from basics has a chapter on data wrangling and aggregation with a lot of recipes.</p><h2 id="python-3-object-oriented-programming-us-eu-">Python 3 Object Oriented Programming [<a href="https://amzn.to/2LwlmWI">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2XRErE5">EU</a>]</h2><p>All about OOP in Python. Start with what is OOP and what benefits it has and goes into details of implementing it in Python - MRO, magic methods, getter/setters, etc. Has a nice chapter on exception handling and # General stuff. Touches packaging briefly. There are also some implementation of popular design patterns</p><h2 id="python-unlocked-us-eu-">Python Unlocked [<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ydw1XM">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2XSayDB">EU</a>]</h2><p>First, 4 chapters are just Python basics that are better covered elsewhere. I really liked the TDD chapter and optimization with C. There are also some implementation of popular design patterns</p><h2 id="flask-web-development-us-eu-">Flask Web Development [<a href="https://amzn.to/2VQCJFN">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2GS4vJL">EU</a>]</h2><p>The best introduction to the most popular Python web-framework. The author - Miguel Grinberg - also has a great blog with a lot of examples. He also authored a number of Flask plugins. Author chapter by chapter builds a simple blogging platform, covering a lot of topics in web development.</p><h1 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h1><h2 id="programming-collective-intelligence-us-eu-">Programming Collective Intelligence [<a href="https://amzn.to/2HanAXy">US</a>] [<a href="https://amzn.to/2JcVVrq">EU</a>]</h2><p>I've started getting acquainted with machine learning with this book. It covers basic ideas from the ground up and doesn't rely on knowledge of statistics and deeper math. The author is not using Python ML ecosystem and builds all algorithms from the start - which is pretty good if you want to understand the internals of the algorithms. The book covers recommendation systems, classifiers, clustering, and regression models as well as less obvious searching and ranking, optimization and genetic programming.</p>
